# HeadStart

**Motivation:**
The Website HeadStart intends to help pair up companies and individuals who want to help others by microloaning them money. The website wants to 
partner up those who need money and those who have money based on their needs and interests as a way to find the best fit. In this way, the website will help those that are in need, and possibly live in poverty, to grow financially and to invest in themselves by furthering their education or even opening their own business, and will also allow those who are already financially stable to give back to the community.

**What it does:**

HeadStart allows individuals to create an account as a sponsor or as someone who is loooking to loan money. When creating an account, the website automatically 
stores the users informations into a database by using Firebase, which also allow us to authenticate individuals when they want to login and to make unique user IDs as a way to protect those who are using the website.
Eventually, HeadStart website will have a page after the user logged in which will allow for the user who is looking to loan money to input the amount needed, what the amount is for, and thewebsite will calculate the interest that will be paid throughout the amount of years that the user has chosen. If the user is an sponsor, then they will be allowed to enter the amount of money they are willing to loan and their what interests them, this way they will be partnered up with an user that needs money for a cause that matter for the sponsors as well. 

**Future Improvements:**
In the future we intend to be able to joing the website with the equations on Java in order to create one product that will fulfill all of out goals. 


**How it does/Built with:**
HeadStart uses HTML5, Firebase, Boostrap, Javascript, and Java.
